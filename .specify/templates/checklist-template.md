## Constitution Compliance (MANDATORY)

Based on `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- [ ] CHK001 Code is 100% C language (no Python, shell scripts, etc. for core functionality)
- [ ] CHK002 Uses TCP sockets (SOCK_STREAM with AF_INET) exclusively
- [ ] CHK003 Server accepts port number as command-line argument
- [ ] CHK004 Client accepts IP/domain and port as command-line arguments
- [ ] CHK005 Both programs validate command-line arguments
- [ ] CHK006 Server executes commands remotely (not on client)
- [ ] CHK007 Server captures both stdout and stderr
- [ ] CHK008 Client displays output received from server
- [ ] CHK009 Supports standard commands: ls, ps, pwd, date, cat, whoami
- [ ] CHK010 Rejects or safely handles dynamic commands (top, htop)
- [ ] CHK011 Rejects or safely handles directory-changing commands (cd)
- [ ] CHK012 Client disconnects cleanly on "salir" or "exit"
- [ ] CHK013 Server continues running after client disconnect
- [ ] CHK014 All source files have file headers (purpose, author, date)
- [ ] CHK015 All functions have documentation comments
- [ ] CHK016 Complex logic has inline comments
- [ ] CHK017 Variables use descriptive names (not single-letter except counters)

## Compilation & Portability

- [ ] CHK018 Compiles without errors on Linux
- [ ] CHK019 Compiles without errors on MacOS
- [ ] CHK020 Compiles without warnings using gcc -Wall -Wextra
- [ ] CHK021 Uses C99 or C11 standard only (no GNU extensions)
- [ ] CHK022 No platform-specific code (or properly abstracted)

## Error Handling & Memory Management

- [ ] CHK023 All system calls check return values
- [ ] CHK024 Errors reported using perror() or equivalent
- [ ] CHK025 Client distinguishes connection errors from command errors
- [ ] CHK026 Server doesn't crash on malformed input
- [ ] CHK027 Resource cleanup occurs even on error paths
- [ ] CHK028 All malloc()/calloc() calls have corresponding free()
- [ ] CHK029 No memory leaks (verified with valgrind)
- [ ] CHK030 Buffer sizes defined as constants (not magic numbers)
- [ ] CHK031 Buffer overflows prevented

## Socket Programming Best Practices

- [ ] CHK032 Server uses socket(), bind(), listen(), accept()
- [ ] CHK033 Client uses socket(), connect()
- [ ] CHK034 Uses send()/recv() or write()/read() consistently
- [ ] CHK035 Handles partial sends (loops until all data sent)
- [ ] CHK036 Handles partial receives (loops until expected data received)
- [ ] CHK037 Sets SO_REUSEADDR on server socket
- [ ] CHK038 Closes sockets properly

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] CHK039 Local test passes (localhost client-server)
- [ ] CHK040 Remote test passes (different hosts client-server)
- [ ] CHK041 Multiple commands tested (at least 5 different commands)
- [ ] CHK042 Error cases tested (invalid port, connection refused, etc.)
- [ ] CHK043 Large output tested (cat large file, ls large directory)
- [ ] CHK044 Concurrent connections handled or gracefully rejected

## Documentation & Deliverables

- [ ] CHK045 README.md includes compilation instructions
- [ ] CHK046 README.md includes usage instructions
- [ ] CHK047 Screenshot of local test captured
- [ ] CHK048 Screenshot of remote test captured
- [ ] CHK049 PDF document created with all required sections
- [ ] CHK050 PDF includes complete source code
- [ ] CHK051 PDF includes screenshots
- [ ] CHK052 Source files (.c, .h) ready for email attachment
- [ ] CHK053 No compiled binaries in email attachment
- [ ] CHK054 Zoom review session scheduled
